# Connecting MySQl service to PMM Client

```bash
# Let's check Percona MySQL container IP, if you are running MySQL with a container
docker inspect -f '{{range.NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' your_container_id
#Example: 172.17.0.4
```

For configuring PMM for monitoring MySQL we need to create a PMM user.

First, log into MySQL

```bash
docker run -it --rm percona mysql -h 172.17.0.4 -uroot -p
# Use password: root
```

```sql
CREATE USER 'pmm'@'172.17.0.3' IDENTIFIED BY 'pass' WITH MAX*USER_CONNECTIONS 10;
GRANT SELECT, PROCESS, REPLICATION CLIENT, RELOAD, BACKUP_ADMIN ON *.\_ TO 'pmm'@'172.17.0.3';
```

- Where 'pmm' is the user
- Replacing pass with your desired password
- Replacing localhost with the IP address of the PMM Client container.

```bash
#And finally, register the MySQL server for monitoring:
docker exec pmm-client pmm-admin add mysql --username=pmm --password=pass --host 172.17.0.4 --query-source=perfschema
```

- Where "--host 172.17.0.4" is the IP of MySQL

```

```
